# Hello there :)

I am a person who's interested in programming and understanding how/why things work.
Though I enjoy programming, I don't really use GitHub often so I don't show all my projects. My favorite programming languages so far are Rust, Python, and Java. I want to learn more about embedded and low-level programming in the future.

### Current projects
- T-Hack, a minecraft hack client/mod that is added via a forge mod
  - T-Hack 0.1.2 will likely be released by November, now with Discord RPC, a command handler, and the ability to save/load configuration files as well as a few small additions so stay tuned for updates! Progress will be slower from now on due to more IRL stuff going on
  - 2022 update: I got bored of modding video games, unless i get more support I'm only releasing 0.2.0 then stopping
  - also really not interested in the community that I originally built this mod for because it's a bit repulsive
- My website, TetrisLitHub.github.io
- playing around with Rust and Assembly for low level/bootable code (potentially a full OS) (my favorite project so far!)
- playing around with DLL/code injection in Rust, it's fun but it feels kinda icky to write since i'm doing so many weird operations
- Java/Kotlin websocket chatroom (probably not gonna do this since i have nowhere to host servers and i'm more interested in low-level now)
- I've been messing around with the Godot engine and GDscript, it's teaching me a lot about how action listeners work

### Project ideas
- Build an autoclicker or keyboard/mouse control thing
- Platformer game in LibGDX
- Continue learning Godot

### Finished projects/projects no longer in development
- DLLinjector - a very simple lightweight DLL injector I created using the C++ windows library
- T-hack will likely not be continued for much longer unless there's enough support. I don't really have as much of an interest in it as i do for other things, and I don't have enough time to write mods either.

### What I'm learning
- Rust (heard about it while researching C++, got super sidetracked and now I'm more interested in Rust than C++)
- Assembly (learning it for making a bootable rust program)
- Data analysis and prediction in python, with numpy, scikit, matplotlib, and pandas
