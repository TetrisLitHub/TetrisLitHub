# Hello there :)

I am a person who's interested in programming, and making and breaking things.

### Current projects
- T-Hack, a minecraft hack client that is added via a forge mod
  - T-Hack 0.1.2 will likely be released by November, now with Discord RPC, a command handler, and the ability to save/load configuration files as well as a few small additions so stay tuned for updates! Progress will be slower from now on due to more IRL stuff going on
  - 2022 update: I got bored of modding video games, unless i get more support I'm only releasing one 0.1.2 then stopping
- My website, TetrisLitHub.github.io
- playing around with Rust and Assembly for low level/bootable code
- Java websocket chatroom

### Project ideas
- Build an autoclicker or keyboard/mouse control thing
- Platformer game in LibGDX

### Finished projects/projects no longer in development
- DLLinjector, a very simple lightweight DLL injector I created using the C++ windows library
- T-hack will likely not be continued for much longer unless there's enough support. I don't really have as much of an interest in it as i do for other things, and I don't have enough time to write mods either.

### What I'm learning
- Rust (heard about it while researching C++, got super sidetracked and now I'm more interested in Rust than C++)
- Assembly (learning it for making a bootable rust program)
