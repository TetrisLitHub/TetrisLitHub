# Hello there :)

I am a person who's interested in programming, and making and breaking things.

### Current projects
- T-Hack, a minecraft hack client that is added via a forge mod
  - T-Hack 0.1.2 will likely be released within the next 2-3 weeks, now with Discord RPC, a command handler, and the ability to save/load configuration files as well as a few small additions so stay tuned for updates!
- My website, TetrisLitHub.github.io

### Project ideas
- {UNNAMED}, an autoclicker that can attatch itself to any process through DLL injection. It will have a variable CPS in order to bypass anticheats and avoid problems.
- Integrate T-Hack with the PanelStudio library by lukflug

### Finished projects/projects no longer in development
- DLLinjector, a very simple lightweight DLL injector I created using the C++ windows library
