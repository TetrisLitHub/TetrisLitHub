# Hello :)

I am a person who's interested in understanding how/why things work.
Though I enjoy programming, I don't really use GitHub often so I don't show all my projects. My favorite programming languages so far are Rust, Python, and Java. I want to learn more about embedded and low-level programming in the future.

### Current projects
- Working on OS development using Assembly and Rust (probably my favorite/most active project so far)
- tetrislithub.github.io is where my "website" is that I mostly use for practicing html and js

### What I'm Learning
- Rust (heard about it while researching C++, got super sidetracked and now I'm more interested in Rust than C++)
- Data analysis, neural networks, and prediction in python using numpy, scikit, matplotlib, and pandas
- Kotlin and Java
- Godot engine and GDscript, it's teaching me a lot about how action listeners work
  - in a similar vein, LibGDX
- playing around with DLL/code injection in Rust, it's fun but it feels odd to write since i'm doing so many weird operations
- going to learn Visual Basic later

### Project ideas
- an autoclicker or keyboard/mouse control thing
- learning how to handle microphone and camera input and screen-recording
- IPC/RPC library for Rust
- build a mini programming language by coding an interpreter
- Memory hacking and DLL injection
- Anticheats in Rust
- Building games in Godot and LibGDX
  - Platformer games
  - maybe a FNAF style game?
- Simulating physics in 2d (inspired by [AngeTheGreat's engine simulator](https://github.com/ange-yaghi/engine-sim))
- learn VST3 someday

### Finished and scrapped projects
- Worked on the website for BinaryHeart: www.binaryheart.org
- DLLinjector, a very simple lightweight DLL injector I created using the C++ windows library
- T-hack is no longer in development due to me losing interest in minecraft modding and the community I built the mod for. I completed part of 0.2.0 (which added Discord RPC, a command handler, the ability to save/load configuration files, and a few other things) so those commits are in the repository. So if you have gradle, you can build the most up-to-date version yourself.
- Java/Kotlin websocket chatroom, scrapped because I had nowhere to host the server and the clientside internet connection sometimes auto-blocked the incoming messages.
